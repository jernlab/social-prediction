# Surveys

Each CSV file is a survey that can be uploaded to and ran on <a href="formr.org">FormR</a>. These were programatically generated using the Python scripts in the `<root>/PythonScripts/SurveyCreation/`
directory. The three surveys are:
- ```survey-context-rater-experiment.csv``` - Used for Experiment 1
- ```nonSocialSurvey.csv``` - Used for Non-Social group in Experiment 2
- ```socialSurvey.csv``` - Used for social group in Experiment 2
