0,note,startScreen,"You are being invited to participate in a research study about human reasoning. This study is being conducted by Alan Jern, Ph.D., from the Department of Humanities, Social Sciences, and the Arts at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. There are no known risks or costs if you decide to participate in this research study. In this study, you will be asked to answer a few questions or make some judgments. There are no right or wrong answers. We are only interested in whether people tend to give similar answers. The information collected may not benefit you directly, but the information learned in this study could help us to better understand how people think and reason. The data from this study will be shared publicly, but your responses will be anonymized so that they cannot be linked to your identity. Your participation in this study is voluntary and you may leave at any time. By completing the survey, you are voluntarily agreeing to participate. If you have any questions about the study, please contact Alan Jern at jern@rose-hulman.edu. If you have any questions about your rights as a research subject or if you feel youâ€™ve been placed at risk, you may contact the Institutional Reviewer, Daniel Morris, by phone at (812) 877-8314, or by e-mail at morris@rose-hulman.edu.",,,,,,,
