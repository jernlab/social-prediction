Explanation coding procedure
----------------------------

We will code an explanation as a "guess" if it contains some version of the following language:
* "guess"
* "no idea" / "no clue"
* "don't know"
* some indication that their answer is arbitrary or they are not basing it on any justification or rationale

Additionally, regardless of whether the explanation uses any of the above language, it MUST NOT provide a reason or justification for the response (even a bad or unclear one).

Even circular, poorly articulated, or subjectively "bad" explanations are coded as explanations.

For example:
* "I have no idea, but it seems like the number of trains would have to be higher" would NOT count as a guess because the explanation provided a reason for the response.
* "Not sure" WOULD count as a guess because the explanation indicates that they are not basing the response on any justification or rationale (even though they don't explicitly use the word "guess")
